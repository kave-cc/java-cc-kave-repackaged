you can build the root module, but maintain and deploy the submodules individually!!!!

to create a repackaged submodule, follow the same template as for the other modules.

- cc.kave.repackaged as group-id
- cc.kave.repackaged.root as parent
- include name, description, and license fields... include the original team/authors, list yourself as an integrator os something alike!!
